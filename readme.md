#Kitten Shrink Ray

Kitten Shrink Ray is a lossless image optimization tool created for Web Designers and Developers.

It takes any PNG you feed it and runs it through a ton of different algorithms to compress it to the **smallest possible size** without altering any pixel of the image!

We intend to make this cross-platform (Windows, Ubuntu, and OSX).

Current idea for max compression:

1. PngOptimizer
2. PNGOut
3. OptiPNG
4. zopfli
5. PngOptimizer
5. PNGOut
6. OptiPNG
7. DeflOpt
8. defluff

More experimentation needs done, but this is the best I've found so far.
